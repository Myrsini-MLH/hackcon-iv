          <h4>How do I get to Hackcon?</h4>
          <p>The closest airport to the venue is the <a href="http://www.flydenver.com/">Denver International Airport (DEN)</a>. You can find cheap flights there from Southwest, Frontier, and United. We'll have shuttle buses going to and from the Airport on Friday and Sunday. If you're driving, there will be parking at the venue. You are responsible for covering your own travel to Denver.</p>

          <h4>When should I arrive / depart?</h4>
          <p>The conference will begin on Friday late afternoon (note: in the past the conference started on Saturday).  You should try to land in the morning or early afternoon on Friday so you don't miss any of the content.  The conference will end on Sunday afternoon by 3pm.  Keep in mind that there's 1.5 - 2 hour drive between the venue and airport.</p>

          <h4>Where will I stay during Hackcon?</h4>
          <p>All Hackcon tickets include housing for two nights (Friday and Saturday).  The rooms accommodate between 3 and 5 people and separated by gender.  We purposely assign rooms so that you'll be staying with organizers from other events so you can make new friends. If you have special room requests, please let us know after you purchase your ticket.</p>

          <h4>Can I have a discount?</h4>
          <p>No.  Hackcon tickets are already heavily subsidized and we cannot give any additional discounts.  For comparison, most professional conferences cost upwards of $500 and don't include housing or food.  If you really can't afford it, we are offering some scholarships based on financial need.</p>

          <p>We're sad you won't be able to join us! You can get a full refund for your ticket before May 1st.  After that, we won't be able to refund you because we'll have already paid for everything.  You can transfer your ticket to someone else if you let us know.</p>

          <h4>I'm under 18, can I still attend?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely. Minors can attend if their parents will sign a liability waiver. Unfortunately, minors cannot stay overnight in the provided housing and will need to find their own accommodations. The YMCA has a hotel on campus that you may be able to book a room in.</p>
